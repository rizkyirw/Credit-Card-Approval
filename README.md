## Credit-Card-Approval
The Credit Card Approval Program uses the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict approval for credit card issuance

## What the Problem?
A bank needs to distribute credit to customers so that the bank can make big profits. One of the bank products offered is a credit card. If the credit card is not held by the right customer, it will result in delays in paying credit card bills. Therefore, banks need a way to detect potential customers who will be given approval to get a credit card. Among the alternative solutions developed is the Data Science method which applies a framework that has been widely used in the industrial world, namely the CRISP-DM framework. This framework is further broken down into a sequence of 11 steps, including: understanding business goals, understanding technical data science goals, understanding and carrying out initial data processing, creating modeling scenarios, creating reliable models, evaluating modeling, and reviewing data science projects. This solution is used to identify factors that contribute to credit card issuance approval. The prediction results are then used by banks to prevent delays in credit card bill payments.

The main data source for the purposes of developing this predictive model is the results of a survey using internal bank data with customer datasets collected over the last few years. The dataset contains: A1,A2…,A15. Here A16 is the dependent variable (the label you are looking for). It should be noted that column names have been deliberately deleted so that they cannot be read by unauthorized people.

The main aim of using Data Science methods in this case is to produce an accurate predictive model that can be used to: (1) identify key variables that influence approval for credit card issuance, and (2) predict approval for credit card issuance. From the results of predictive modeling with Data Science, it is hoped that it can provide input to banks to approve credit card issuance.
